 ## 🚀 SkipUacTaskCreator
✨ Create elevated tasks with just one click and run your programs without seeing the UAC prompt!

</br>



**"SkipUacTaskCreator"**, also known as **SUTOCC** (***SkipUacTaskOneClickCreator***), lets you easily create administrator tasks for Windows Task Scheduler, so you can run programs that require elevated privileges without the UAC confirmation window.



## 🌟 Features
- ⚡ **The program doesn't trigger any UAC prompt when creating tasks!** 💪
- 📁 **Multi-file support:** select and process a large number of programs at once.
- 🧠 **Easy to use and super fast:** just a click and you're done. 


## 🛠️ How to Use
- 🖱️ **Context menu:** Select files > Right-click > "Send to" → `"SkipUacTaskCreator"`
- 🪟 **Main window:** Launch `SkipUacTaskCreator-Window` > Drag & drop files > click **SUTOCC** icon.
- 💻 **Command Line:** Pass files as arguments to `Accumulator.exe` (supports drag & drop onto the executable).


## ⚙️ Functionality
-  SkipUacTaskCreator makes use of an accumulator to pass files as arguments that doesn't trigger any UAC prompt.
- If you'd prefer to confirm via UAC the task creation process, run "switch NoUAC ↔ UAC (both ways).exe" (which can also restore default behaviour).
